This package demonstrate the use of Maxide method proposed in [1].  

-System requirement:
	The code is tested in MATLABr2013a under Windows 64 bit system and MATLABr2013a under Linux 64 bit system.
-Install
	Go to ./Maxide, compile the xumm.c file using ">>mex xumm.c"
	The compiled files for Windows 64 bit and Linux 64 bit are included in the package
-Files
	The folder "Maxide" contains all the functions needed for the methods proposed in [1].
	The folder "data" contains the Yahoo Arts data [2].
	"Demo_Simulation.m" demos the use of Maxide on synthetic data when n=m=1000, r=10 and r_A=r_B=20.
	"Demo_Multi_Label.m" demos the use of Maxide on multi-label Yahoo Arts data [2].
